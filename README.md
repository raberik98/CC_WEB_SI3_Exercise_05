# CC_WEB_SI3_Exercise_05
In this task we will practice some good practices regarding React. 
For the best experience it is recommended that you complete this task with a mentor with him/her providing context and explanation at every step.
This task for live coding can be useful for beginners and for those who have some grip on React but could use some additional help.

1; Let's go through the starter code, the Mentor should provide some context, and answer any question you might have. (Proxy, folder structure, bootstrap, React-Router-DOM)


2; The Mentor should talk about useState and useEffect.  Let's fetch to the backend server to get the data of every picture available. A student should do this part. Let's discuss what is happening.


3; The Mentor should talk about React's component based architecture, how could we refactor the Shop.jsx to implement this architecture better, what code snippet could be turned into a reusable component? A student should do the refactoring.


4; The Mentor should talk about how to handle loading time and what is conditional rendering. The Mentor should also explain what throttling is and how is it useful.
A student should implement conditional rendering to display a message when the backend server sends an empty array for the pictures.
